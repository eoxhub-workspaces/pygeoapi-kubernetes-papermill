Subject: [PATCH] Allow specifying `job_id` via request parameter

This is somewhat unconventional with REST design and leaves it up to the
process implementation to deal with duplicates and invalid IDs, however
it can make sense in certain use cases.

An alternative design would be to encode the desired `job_id` in the url:
`POST /processes/<process_id>/jobs/<job_id>`
This would suggest full control over the `job_id` from the client side,
so I'd prefer to pass the id via POST data. This way we can treat it as
suggestion, or possibly as a template from which the server derives the
actual id.
